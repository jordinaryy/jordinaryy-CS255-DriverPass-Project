# jordinaryy-CS255-DriverPass-Project

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was all about designing a system for a client who wanted to help students prepare for their driving tests. The goal was to create a user-friendly system where students could schedule driving lessons, access online study materials, and track their progress. The client needed an efficient, well-organized system that could handle multiple users, schedule appointments with instructors, and provide learning resources.

What did you do particularly well?

One thing I think I did particularly well was translating user needs into system design. I focused on creating clear documentation, especially in my business requirements document and system design document, to ensure that the project met the client’s expectations. I also paid close attention to user experience (UX) by designing a system that was simple and intuitive, making it easy for students to navigate.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could improve one part of my work, it would be my UML diagrams—Sequence, Activity, and Class Diagrams. They were a bit lackluster and could have been more detailed and structured. My Sequence Diagram needed more interactions and error-handling steps to show a complete flow. The Activity Diagram could have used better decision points and clearer separation between roles. My Class Diagram lacked strong relationships between entities, and I should have included cardinality to define them properly. Improving these diagrams would make the system easier to understand, implement, and debug, ensuring better communication across the development team. Moving forward, I’d focus on refining these aspects to create more effective and well-structured designs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Understanding the user’s needs was key in this project. I made sure to gather specific requirements from the client and then structured my design to meet those expectations. For example, students needed a simple way to book lessons, so I designed a straightforward scheduling system with real-time availability updates. Considering user needs is crucial in system design because if a system is too complicated or doesn’t solve the problem effectively, people won’t use it—no matter how advanced the tech behind it is.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I like to start by breaking down the problem into smaller pieces. I used a mix of structured analysis and UML diagrams to map out the system. In the future, I would focus even more on agile methodologies—getting early feedback and making incremental improvements instead of trying to finalize everything at once. Also, incorporating more user testing during the design phase would help identify issues before they become bigger problems.
